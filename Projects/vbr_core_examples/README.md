# vbr_core_examples
This directory contains cookbooks (CBs) that illustrate how to call the VBR core calculator. 

They assume that the VBRc is in your working path. If running from this directory, you can do the following to add the VBRc to your path: 

```shell
path_to_top_level_vbr='../../';
addpath(path_to_top_level_vbr)
vbr_init
```

replace `path_to_top_level_vbr` with the correct relative path if you are running these examples from a different directory.
