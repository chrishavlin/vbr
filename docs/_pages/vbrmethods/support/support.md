    %     'z_min_km', scalar
    %       only used if 'method'=='Q_factor`, this value (default 80 km) defines the

    %   p(var1, var2, ...) = p(var1) * p(var2) * ...
    %
    % Parameters
    % ----------
    % states: structure
    %   A structure with the following fields for each state in the

    %       If set, this is the PDF type to use (optional), must be one of
    %       'normal', 'lognormal', 'uniformlog' or 'uniform'. This
    %        option is overridden by the following field if it exists.
    %    [field]_pdf : matrix (optional)
    %       If there is a field [var_name]_pdf, then use that probability
    %       as the prior for that variable instead of calculating it
    %
    % states_fields: cell array
    %    names of all of the state variables we are varying. Each field name
    %    should exist in the states structure.
    %

    %
    % Notes
    % -----
    %
    % Papers report heat capacity (J/mol/K) as polynomial functions of
    % temperature with coefficients determined by fitting. To get to specific
    % heat (J/kg/K), we divide the reported coefficients by molecular weight of
    % the minerals. The function form is typically:
    %
    %  Cp = B(1) + B(2)*T + B(3)*T^2 + B(4)*T^-2 + B(5)*T^-3 + ...
    %       B(6)*T^-0.5 + B(7)/T
    %
    % In this implementation, the array B initially has two rows, with values
    % for forsterite (Fo) in the first row and fayalite (Fa) in the second row.
    % The two are then linearly weighted by the fraction of forsterite in the
    % mantle before calculating Cp.
